## Encrypic
![alt text](https://github.com/ImErvin/Encrypic/blob/master/Encrypic/Assets/eplogo.png?raw=true "Encrypic Logo")

A Universal Windows Platform(UWP) application built using the MVVM design to easily build the application to any UWP device (phone, desktop, hololens etc.). This is a project for my Mobile Applications Development 3 module in college. The basic idea is to make use of the powerful MVVM design pattern and use my knowledge of RESTful APIs and Databases to create a full stack UWP application.

The idea behind Encrypic is to create an application that allows users to send encrypted images to eachother and provide a private key to decrypt those images. The sender can choose to self-destruct the image after decryption or to re-encrypt the image and provide the private key again.
