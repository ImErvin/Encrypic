A Universal Windows Platform(UWP) application built using the MVVM design to build the application to any UWP device. This is a project for my Mobile Applications Development 3 module in college. The basic idea is to make use of the powerful MVVM design pattern and use my knowledge of RESTful APIs and Databases to create a UWP application.
